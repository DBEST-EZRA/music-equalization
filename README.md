# Audio Equalization and Frequency Manipulation Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates audio equalization and frequency manipulation using Python. By treating an audio signal as a linear combination of sine waves, we can analyze and modify its frequency components to emphasize or diminish specific ranges. This approach enables selective audio adjustments, such as enhancing bass or treble, which are fundamental techniques in audio equalization.

## Project Structure
1. **Audio Loading and Channel Separation**  
   We load an audio file and separate it into left and right channels for independent manipulation. The original audio file is sampled and analyzed to understand its duration, sample rate, and channel composition.

2. **Signal Visualization**  
   Visualizations include both the time-domain signal and the frequency spectrum. These plots allow for a clear understanding of the audio signalâ€™s frequency distribution and make it easier to identify which coefficients correspond to specific sound ranges (e.g., bass or treble).

3. **Frequency Filtering**  
   By masking portions of the sine wave coefficients, we manipulate specific frequency ranges:
   - **Bass Emphasis**: Retain only the lower frequencies by setting the higher-frequency coefficients to zero.
   - **Treble Emphasis**: Retain the higher frequencies by reducing the amplitude of lower-frequency coefficients.

4. **Inverse Transform and Audio Reconstruction**  
   The manipulated frequency coefficients are converted back to the time domain using an inverse sine transform. The resulting modified signals are saved as new audio files for comparison.

## Key Files
- `Here_Comes_The_Sun.wav`: Original audio file used for analysis.
- `lower_volume_song.wav`: A version of the song with volume reduced by 50%.
- `bass_test.wav`: Modified version with enhanced bass frequencies.
- `trebble_test.wav`: Modified version with enhanced treble frequencies.

## How to Run
1. Load the audio file into the environment and install necessary libraries (e.g., `scipy`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`).
2. Execute the cells step-by-step to load, analyze, and manipulate the audio data.
3. Download the output `.wav` files to listen to and observe the effects of each frequency manipulation.

## Results
Each modified audio file demonstrates different aspects of frequency manipulation:
- **Volume Reduction**: Demonstrates scalar multiplication across all frequency coefficients.
- **Bass and Treble Adjustments**: Show how selective coefficient masking emphasizes certain frequency ranges, altering the song's character accordingly.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the potential of frequency manipulation in audio processing by adjusting the amplitude of sine wave components. This foundational concept in equalization allows for tailored audio experiences by emphasizing or diminishing specific sound ranges.
